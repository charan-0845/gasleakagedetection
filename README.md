# ðŸš¨ Gas Leakage Detection System using ESP32 (Gas Guard)

An **IoT-enabled Gas Leakage Detection System** built using **ESP32** and **MQ-5 Gas Sensor**.  
The system detects gas leakage in real-time and alerts users via **buzzer, LEDs, LCD Display, Firebase, and Telegram bot**.  
Additionally, a servo can be triggered to control safety mechanisms automatically.
